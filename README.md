## :bookmark_tabs: Introduction

Mummy Maze is a game where the hero is a treasure hunter. While searching for lost treasures,
the game hero goes through several levels where he must avoid being caught by enemies and
traps.

</div>

In each level or chamber there is a passage to the next level/chamber. The goal of the hero is to
reach that passage avoiding threats: being caught by and enemy or falling in a trap. The passage
to the next level is the cell next to the stairs (see next figure).

This is a turn-based game, where, in each turn, the hero moves first, and only after that the
enemies move (even if the hero has reached the goal cell).

## :page_with_curl: Project Sheet

You should develop an application that uses search algorithms to play the Mummy Maze. You
should develop at least two distinct heuristics suitable to the problem to be used by informed
algorithms. The application should allow the user to choose the level to be solved, the algorithm
to be used and the heuristic (if applicable).

You can find the full project sheet [here](https://docdro.id/L9rvvSq) and the final project report [here](Relatorio_IA.pdf).
